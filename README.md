# Project 2: HumanResources using SQLandTableau

For this project, and many to follow, I am using data from https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/project-summary?agentid=markbradbourne&datasetid=rwfd-real-world-fake-data
which has an incredible library of data to clean and explore.

In this project I cleaned the data and did EDA. I created a ***dynamic*** dashboard in Tableau using metrics I found to be interesting: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benjamin.stringer/viz/HumanResources-GenderLocationAgeProject/Dashboard1

It's my first ***dynamic*** dashboard so I was extremely stoked with the results!
